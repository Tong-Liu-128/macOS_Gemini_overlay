# MacOS_Gemini_overlay
**This tool is based on *macos-grok-overlay* by tchlux**

Frustrated with OpenAI or ChatGPT's performance? Want to try Google Gemini but prefer a dedicated client over a website for better efficiency? This tool offers a solution. Similar to the 'Option + Space' shortcut in ChatGPT client, it provides overlay window access. However, instead of limiting you to one conversation, this tool grants broader access to Gemini's features within the overlay.

## installation
Download *Gemini.dmg* from this repo, install it, and you are good to go!

## If running in terminal:
Pull this repo and run *run.py* in terminal, you may need to solve dependency issues by yourself.

## Usage
Once installed, open it, sign in with your google account, set your favourite hotkey, and simply start your work flow. 

# Tips:
Please allow accessibility control for this tool because it relies on it to access keyboard input in order to set a hotkey.
