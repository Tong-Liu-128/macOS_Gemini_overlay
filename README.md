# MacOS_Gemini_overlay
**This tool is based on *macos-grok-overlay* by tchlux**

Frustrated with OpenAI or ChatGPT's performance? Want to try Google Gemini but prefer a dedicated client over a website for better efficiency? This tool offers a solution. Similar to the 'Option + Space' shortcut in ChatGPT client, it provides overlay window access. However, instead of limiting you to one conversation, this tool grants broader access to Gemini's features within the overlay.
